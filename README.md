dev experience

react is a JS library for building interactive UI
elements that users see and interact with on screen

library, react provides helpful functions (APIs) to build UI

Nextjs handles tooling and config needed for react
You can use React for UI
and nextjs features to solve common app req such as routing, data fetching and caching.

how browsers interpret code to create or render UI:
user visits webpage
server returns html file to browser
browser reads html
constructs document object model - basically the structure e.g. h1 tag nested in body tag

DOM is object rep of html elements, tree like structure with parent and child relationships.

You can use DOM methods and JS to listen to user events and manipulate DOM - selecting, adding, updating and deleting specific elements in UI. Target specific elements (Paragraphs), change style and content.
